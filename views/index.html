                            <p class="card-text">    Communication: Computer networks facilitate the exchange of data and information between devices. This communication can occur within a local area (LAN - Local Area Network) or over larger distances (WAN - Wide Area Network) across cities, countries, or even globally.

                                Protocols: To ensure efficient and standardized communication, computer networks use various protocols such as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). These protocols define rules and conventions for data transmission and ensure data integrity and reliability.
                            
                                Topologies: Computer networks can be structured in different topologies, such as bus, star, ring, or mesh. Each topology determines how devices are connected and how data flows within the network.
                            
                                Internet: The internet is the largest and most well-known computer network, connecting billions of devices worldwide. It enables global communication, access to information, and services through websites, email, social media, and more.
                            
                                Network Security: With the increased reliance on networks, ensuring network security becomes critical. Network security involves measures to protect data, devices, and communication from unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber threats.
                            
                                Network Components: Various hardware and software components form a computer network. Hardware components include network cables, routers, switches, network interface cards (NICs), and more. Software components include network operating systems, firewalls, and network management tools.
                            
                                Types of Networks: There are different types of computer networks, including LANs, WANs, wireless networks (Wi-Fi), metropolitan area networks (MANs), and virtual private networks (VPNs), each serving specific purposes.

                            <p class="card-text">    On-Demand Self-Service: Users can provision and manage computing resources, such as virtual machines and storage, without requiring human intervention from the service provider.

                                Broad Network Access: Cloud services are accessible over the internet through various devices, including laptops, tablets, smartphones, and desktop computers.
                            
                                Resource Pooling: Cloud providers consolidate computing resources to serve multiple users, allowing efficient utilization and distribution of resources.
                            
                                Rapid Elasticity: Cloud services can rapidly scale up or down based on demand, ensuring flexibility and cost optimization for users.
                            
                                Measured Service: Cloud computing resources are metered, allowing users to pay only for the resources they consume, similar to utility billing models.
                            
                            Cloud computing is typically classified into three primary service models:
                            
                                Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): In this model, cloud providers offer virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networking components to build their own IT infrastructure. IaaS provides users with maximum control over the underlying infrastructure.
                            
                                Platform as a Service (PaaS): PaaS offers a platform and development environment where users can build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. It includes tools, frameworks, and services necessary for application development and deployment.
                            
                                Software as a Service (SaaS): SaaS delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users can access these applications through a web browser without needing to install or maintain them locally. Examples of SaaS include email services, productivity suites, and customer relationship management (CRM) software.
                            
                            Benefits of cloud computing:
                            
                                Cost Savings: Cloud computing eliminates the need for upfront capital investments in hardware and data centers. Users can pay for resources on a pay-as-you-go basis, reducing overall IT costs.
                            
                                Scalability and Flexibility: Cloud services can quickly scale up or down based on changing demands, providing businesses with the flexibility to adjust resources as needed.
                            
                                Global Accessibility: Cloud computing enables users to access data and applications from anywhere with an internet connection, facilitating remote work and collaboration.
                            
                                Security and Reliability: Reputable cloud service providers invest heavily in security measures, data encryption, and redundancy to ensure the safety and reliability of user data.
                            
                                Innovation and Agility: Cloud computing offers access to cutting-edge technologies, allowing businesses to experiment, develop, and deploy new applications rapidly.
                            
                                Environmental Impact: Cloud providers often operate energy-efficient data centers, which can be more environmentally friendly compared to traditional on-premises data centers.
